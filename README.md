# AirPollutionDetectionApplication
This project was done as an end of year project.
It consists of an image classification model to detect air pollution.
The model was created with Tensorflow then converted into TensorflowLite model which was integrated in an android application skeleton to create a real time air pollution detection android application which allows the detection of smoke using the smartphone camera.
